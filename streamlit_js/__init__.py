# function, below, that will serve as our component's public API.

    This is a non-blocking streamlit component that executes JavaScript code.

    Parameters
    ----------
    code: str
        The code to be executed by the component.
    key: str or None
        An optional key that uniquely identifies this component. If this is
        None, and the component's arguments are changed, the component will
        be re-mounted in the Streamlit frontend and lose its current state.

    Returns
    -------

        [] if the code is still running.
        [<result>] if the code is finished.
        Where <result> is the value of executed code. It has to be serializable.
        It's already deserialized by Streamlit into Python object.

    Usually it finishes in one rerun, but it's not guaranteed by this function due to Streamlit's nature.

    Parameters
    ----------
